# To Do List Web Site

This project is a simple and elegant To Do List web application that allows users to add, check, and remove tasks with ease.  
It is fully responsive and adapts smoothly to all screen sizes — from mobile phones to desktops — using CSS Media Queries and `rem` units for scalable layout.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can enter a task and click "Add Task" or press Enter to add it to the list.  
- **Mark as Completed**: Each task can be marked as done with a checkbox — the task will appear crossed out in red.  
- **Delete Individual Tasks**: Tasks can be removed individually using a delete (trash) icon.  
- **Clear All Tasks**: A "Clear Tasks" button appears when tasks are added, allowing users to remove all tasks at once.  
- **Live Interaction**: Tasks update instantly without page reloads.  
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is mobile-friendly and adapts to all devices using CSS Media Queries and `rem` units.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web page.  
- **CSS**: For styling, responsiveness, and visual design.  
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity like adding, checking, and deleting tasks.  
- **Font Awesome**: For the trash icon in the task list.
